# Personal Portfolio 

This project was part of my Agency Ready unit in the final year of studies. I was required to build a professional looking 
portfolio website to be ready for the digital industry, in terms of future careers. This website was hand coded using lastest technologies such as HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. Apart from the development aspects, design and User experience was in mind while building the site.
