      <p>“Sass is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language in the world.” (Catlin, Weizenbaum, Eppstein, 2015: online)</p>

      <p>Sass stands for Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets. This type of extension is the buzz for front end web developers, as it allows you to write clean, tidy and organised CSS code. </p>

      <p>The journey started by doing research around this topic, as it was my first time using Sass. The project was to convert my current CSS into Sass from my major project, <a href="http://13001222.webdevmmu.uk/ms-project/" title="Mars Spiders website build for final year project">Mars Spiders site</a>.</p>

      <p><a href="https://abookapart.com/" title="Book Apart collection is platform for web developers to take their skills even further">Book Apart</a> collection has a well written book called <a href="https://abookapart.com/products/sass-for-web-designers"
          title="Sass for Web Designers by Dan Cerholm">"Sass for Web Designers”</a> by Dan Cerholm. Reading this book explained the installation process for Sass; I had to install <a href="http://rubyinstaller.org/" title="Ruby Installer for Windows">Ruby Gems</a> and <a href="https://git-for-windows.github.io/" title="Git for Windows">Git Bash</a> to help towards the pre-processing and compiling the Sass work flow.</p>

      <p>Reading this book gave me a clear understanding of what is required for Sass and what it’s about. Another great resource I used to gain further knowledge was an online tutorial, on <a href="http://www.lynda.com/" title="Online learning platform around digital skills">Lynda</a> called <a href="http://www.lynda.com/Sass-tutorials/Sass-Essential-Training/375925-2.html" title="A useful tutorial to gain in-depth knowledge on Sass">Sass Essential Training</a>. This help me dig even deeper then the book and gave me further understanding around the coding elements of Sass.</p>

      <p>Once the researching was done, it was time to get hands on and implement the Sass into action. The recommended way for the installation of Sass is through Git and Ruby.</p>

      <p>I started to install Git and Ruby for my workflow, because of my current coding ability I found it really difficult to use Git to process and compile my Sass. So to overcome this difficulty, I did more research on installation and came across
        <a href="https://mhs.github.io/scout-app/" title="Scout is a cross-platform app that delivers the power of Sass & Compass into the hands of web designers.">Scout</a>.</p>

      <p>“Scout is a cross-platform app that delivers the power of Sass & Compass into the hands of web designers.” (Human, 2016: online)</p>

      <p>Scout allowed having an easier work flow, as it help towards pre-processing and compiling the Sass files.</p>

      <div class="scout-launch"><img src="../img/scout-launch.jpg" alt="Scout is launch onto the desktop"></div>

      <p>Scout has been launched with my work station.</p>

      <div class="scout-set-up"><img src="../img/scout-set-up.jpg" alt="Setting up the scout"></div>

      <p>To set up the Sass work flow, you need to add your work folders, one for the input which is for SCSS file and one for the output which is stylesheet that will show a CSS file once the Sass is complied.</p>

      <div class="scout-change"><img src="../img/scout-change.jpg" alt="Scout detects changes made through the back-end of SCSS files. The complier picks up these changes."></div>

      <p>Once you’re done your coding in the back-end with Sass. (Text editor) You need to compile the file. You press play button of the work station and let Scout do its magic by compiling the Sass file.</p>

      <div class="css-file"><img src="../img/css-file.jpg" alt="Scout has complied the sass and made an CSS file ready to use on your website"></div>

      <p>Once Sass complied through Scout, you can see the CSS file been made. The CSS files shows what line the code is in the SCSS file, whoever reads the files knows exactly what the code is doing.</p>

      <h2 class="sub-headings">Variables</h2>

      <div class="sass-variables"><img src="../img/sass-variables.png" alt="Variables used in the Sass coding"></div>

      <p>Variables were used to store reused code for example font colours, this reduces repetition.</p>

      <h2 class="sub-headings">Nesting</h2>

      <div class="sass-nesting"><img src="../img/sass-nesting.png" alt="Nesting were used to organise and make the code readable"></div>

      <p>Nesting has been used in the navigation code. ul,li and a, selectors are nested in the nav selector. This makes your code organised and readable.</p>

      <h2 class="sub-headings">Mixins</h2>

      <div class="sass-mixins"><img src="../img/sass-mixins.png" alt="Mixins were used in the Sass coding to group CSS declarations"></div>

      <p>Mixins were used in different parts of the coding elements, to group CSS declarations that I wanted to use throughout the site.</p>

      <h2 class="sub-headings">Partials</h2>

      <div class="sass-partials"><img src="../img/sass-partials.png" alt="Partials can be used to view little CSS snippets"></div>

      <p>Partials files contain snippet of CSS which can be used in other Sass files. This is a great way to organise your CSS and help keep things easier to maintain.</p>

      <h2 class="sub-headings">Extend/Inheritance</h2>

      <div class="sass-extend"><img src="../img/sass-extend.png" alt="Extend allows you to share set of CSS properties"></div>

      <p>Extend is one useful feature when writing Sass. It allows you to share a set of CSS properties from one selector to another.</p>

      <p>The journey has come to an end, and it has truly been a success. Exploiting Sass has improved my skills for sure and certainly I will be implementing Sass in projects in the near future, as they ease the coding work flow.</p>
