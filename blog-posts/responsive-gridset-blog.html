      <h1 class="blog-post-heading">Gridset Responsive Report 2014 Review</h1>

      <p>I have a clear understanding of responsive design as I have used media queries in my university and work experience projects. The way I have learnt about responsive design is by self-learning on professional tutorials like Treehouse and Lynda. With
        extra reading from my favourite books from the Apart book collection, in particular Responsive Web Design Second Edition.</p>

      <p>“In short, we need to practice responsive web design.” (Marcotte, 2014:10)</p>

      <p>I agree with what Marcotte is saying as responsive design is key for companies as they can attract wide range of customers to use their site which will increase sales. There is evidence of increase of mobile usage, for example from 27th July 2015
        mobile usages on twitter have increased immensely. “approx 250 million monthly active users.”(Smith, 2015: online)</p>

      <p>This shows how mobile has evolved in people lives as they are constantly using these powerful devices to surf the internet on the go.</p>

      <p>In terms of skills in the development side, I need to gain more knowledge and understanding of advanced Sass and JavaScript and learn about tools that help towards these areas to make websites more functional, efficient and attractive.</p>

      <p>“Sass feeds any styles to the appropriate media query and reconstructs the declaration with everything in its right place.” (Cederholm, 2013:77) This shows that you can use Sass with responsive design to make your projects more efficient.</p>

      <p>“HTML CSS JS are the THREE front end building blocks.”(Rupert, 2012)</p>

      <p> If I go down the front end development route I am required to know JavaScript and how this web language works with creating interactive and functional website for the users. For example a new thing currently in the industry is React JS which is
        library for building user interfaces.</p>

      <p>“Enables modern HTML5 event stuff on IE 8.” (programmers, 2014: online)</p>

      <p>With react JS it allows events from HTML 5 to work in older browsers like IE 8 which is cool as this is still an issue developers still face when it comes to making a website to support all browsers.</p>

      <p>One thing that fears me is that new technologies are always coming out and I need to learn new skills to support these technologies. This can be slight downfall for me as I may not have the time like I do now to learn skills as once you get into
        the work environments it’s so much different than being a student. I will be constantly on meeting and working on tight deadlines for whoever I work for whether that’s in a corporate company or digital agencies.</p>

      <p>My ambition is to work in the industry with corporate companies or digital agencies and work my way up to the top in my chosen job fields. The careers I would like to go into are digital project management, front-end development or UX Design. I
        would like to become managers of these fields and share my knowledge and skills with future employers and clients.</p>

      <p>“Good qualifications, a strong work ethic and a willingness to learn could get you to the top in the digital sector.” (Edwards, 2012: online)</p>

      <p>So it is so important for me to keep on learning and developing on my skills for my chosen career paths and become successful in my future roles.</p>

      <p>Even as UX Designer or Project Manager you are still required to have some sort of knowledge of responsive design so that you can help your fellow colleagues in coding responsive when there is short time and tight deadlines. In UX you would do sketches
        of wireframes of your products. If a website was your project then you would sketch responsive layout designs.</p>

      <p>“Another approach is using paper and communicating to the client to demonstrate design layouts and how they will reflow on different screen sizes.” (Strelchenko, 2014: online) This shows that responsive is used in different areas of the industry
        not just web developers need to know about responsive.</p>

      <p>Quote from Kamaal Williams while he did a digital project manager internship at Tecmark during the summer of 2015: “Responsive Design was the main focus of all of our projects.”</p>

      <p>The digital industry is full of excitement, individuals with different backgrounds, job roles and skills sets collaborate on projects together. The jobs prospects are increasing in the digital industry. Tech City shows facts and figure of digital
        industry employment as a whole in the United Kingdom. Currently there is “1.46million employed in digital companies” and the digital employment is going to grow by “5.4% by 2020.”(Tech City, 2015:9) I cannot wait to be part of this growing industry
        and sharing my knowledge and skills with future work colleagues and clients.</p>

      <p>Responsive design will always remain within the industry as it is a required practice now as a lot of companies are making separate versions of their company site, one accessible website and the other a mobile site or an app.</p>

      <p>“Go beyond the brief, imagining solutions to problems the client hasn’t even considered yet. Beat the curve and show your worth.” (Johnson, 2015: online)</p>

      <p>It is crucial for me to keep working with responsive design with future projects and find the best solution that would work for me.</p>
