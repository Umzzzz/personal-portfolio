      <h1 class="blog-post-heading">Improvements Of Portfolio Website</h1>

      <div class="new-look"><img src="../img/new-look.png" alt="Improvements made to Umair Yaquoob's Portfolio site"></div>

      <p>Improvements have been made from the feedback I have received from fellow students and from the live marking session done by my tutor few weeks ago.</p>

      <p>There were some minor issues with the first version of the site. First of all I changed the logo to match with the colour scheme of the navigation, which is black background with gold hover. So this made me change the Favicon to match the brand
        identity of Umair Yaquoob. To do this I used an online tool called<a href="http://www.favicon.co.uk/" title="Online Favicon Generator"> Favicon Generator</a>.</p>

      <div class="logo-design"><img src="../img/UY.gif" alt="New design of Umair Yaquoob's logo"></div>

      <p>“Google typically displays the first 50-60 characters of a title tag, or as many characters as will fit into a 512-pixel display. If you keep your titles under 55 characters, you can expect at least 95% of your titles to display properly.” (MOZ,
        no date: online)</p>

      <p>So I decided to do what <a href="https://moz.com/learn/seo/title-tag" title="Information about how to meet Google requirements for Title Tags on websites"> MOZ </a> stated by reducing the title tag to less than 55 characters, so that Google can
        display the titles properly in the browsers tab area, search engine results and external websites.(sharing on social media sites, they use the title tag as its link anchor text)</p>

      <p>Meta description was too short on the main page of the site, so I increased the length of the Meta description to sell myself.</p>

      <p>Previous Meta description:</p>

      <div class="previous-title-tag"><img src="../img/previous-title-tag.png" alt="Previous title tags length on old version of portfolio"></div>

      <p>New Meta description:</p>

      <div class="title-tag"><img src="../img/title-tag.png" alt="Reduced title tags to meet recommend Google requirements"></div>

      <p>In some places, the Alt texts for images were redundant for example I used ‘Image of', which is no use to impaired users. So I approach this issue by making the Alt text more meaningful to the relevant images. On the other hand, related to the navigation
        in responsive mode, the grey colour text was not properly visible in mobile view. So I changed the colour of the text to white, so that it was more clearly visible for the users to read.</p>

      <div class="white-text"><img src="../img/responsive-navigation.jpg" alt="Colour of text changed to white in responsive mode, so its more visible and readable for users"></div>

      <p>In responsive mode, especially the mobile column width, two section on the main page ‘About’ and ‘Blog’, the written content was to narrow. To resolve these issues, I changed the padding to 20px which fixed the problems and allowed the content to
        be more readable.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, this time round I managed to get the off click outside navigation effect to work with advice from Jacob Gray at<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34137223/how-do-a-prevent-a-click-event-occurring-on-a-navigation-on-a-another-page"
          title="A language-independent collaboratively edited question and answer site for programmers"> Stack Overflow</a>.</p>

      <p>While in responsive mode, when the user clicks on the toggle menu, the menu slides down, imagine the user wants to click outside the navigation menu, this effect will make this happen and the navigation menu will disappear automatically, instead
        of clicking the toggle button again.</p>

      <div class="stack-overflow">
        <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/" title="A language-independent collaboratively edited question and answer site for programmers"><img class="hvr-shrink" src="../img/stack-overflow.png" alt="Stack Overflow allows you to ask questions to individuals, with your programming problems"></a>
      </div>

      <p>On the other hand, to make the website load even faster, I managed to minify all the JavaScript files into one Script file. This was done using an online tool called<a href="http://jscompress.com/" title="An online tool that allows you to minify your JavaScript code instantly"> JavaScript Compression Tool</a>.
        Also I minified the CSS, using an online tool called minify your <a href="http://www.cleancss.com/css-minify/" title="CSS minifier to optimize your CSS code to make your website faster."> CSS</a>.</p>

      <p>Final improvement that I have made to the site was replacing the home section icons and social media icons, using the popular web icons platform <a href="https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/" title="Font Awesome allows you to have beautiful scalable vector icons, that can instantly be customised"> Font Awesome</a>.
        Also I have changed the footer text from Umz Designs to Umair Yaquoob to match with the initials in the logo.</p>
