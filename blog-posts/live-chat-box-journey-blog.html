      <p>“If there is a script or program that offers functionality you need, consider using it rather than writing something from scratch.” (Duckett, 2014:412)</p>

      <p>Prior to my own knowledge of live chat box (JavaScript/ API) is minimal. Researching was required to see what’s out there for me to use and easily to implement to Mars Spiders project. I have indeterminate knowledge of JavaScript, as I have use this language in previous projects. Implementing a chat box properly onto a site would enhance my skills even further.</p>

      <p>Developing live instant chat box requires knowledge of JavaScript/ API, in order to implement a live chat box onto a site. There are two types of chat boxes you can have on your websites; they are ‘Embedded chat window’ and ‘Popup chat window'. (Szperlinski: no date: online)</p>

      <p>For example if the user started a chat on the home page and then went to your contact page, the chat box would follow the user and the conversation will continue. To enable this to happen, you have make sure you have your tracking code on all your pages to allow the chat box to follow the users on the whole site.</p>

      <div class="track-code"><img src="../img/tracking-code.png" alt="Tracking code that allows live chat box to work online"></div>

      <p>Popup chat window opens up in a separate browser window. The visitor has a choice of having the popup chat window side by side to your site and accesses both at the same time. The popup chat window stays open even if the visitor leaves the page with the tracking code. This can only be closed manually.</p>

      <p>After obtaining a clear insight to live chat box and JavaScript API Library, it was time for implementing. Implementation of the technology was quite simple due to the fact all important information and knowledge was gained in the research phase.</p>

      <p>There are various JavaScript API live chat box to use for Mars Spiders project. They were <a href="https://www.olark.com/" title="Olark live chat">Olark</a>, <a href="https://developers.livechatinc.com/" title="LiveChat Developers">LiveChat</a> and <a href="https://www.purechat.com/" title="Free Live Chat Software for website">Pure Chat</a>.</p>

      <p>All of the live chat boxes mentioned above are easy to implement onto the site. But there were some limitations. With Olark and LiveChat box, you have to pay subscriptions before you can use the widget.</p>

      <p>Pure Chat allows you to have free subscription up to fifteen chats per month, which was ideal for me, as I could test the features out on the site with users to see if they would use this type of chat box. Pure Chat was so much easier to implement onto Mars Spiders site and it allowed you to have a fully customise chat box to your preferences.</p>

      <p>Pure Chat enable you to set how you would like the chat box to appear on the site, these customisations included before chat, chat open, during chat, after chat, unavailable, email form, triggers, hosted and transcripts. The site needs to be live for you to see the chat box in action.</p>

      <p>In my opinion, embedded chat window is much better, as it creates a better user experience of the site, as it stays fixed in one place, so if the user needs to quickly drop a message to the staff at Mars Spiders, they can instantly without any difficulty.</p>

      <p>The journey has come to an end, and it has truly been a success. Utilising these tools has improved my skills for sure and undoubtedly I will be implementing JavaScript API in more projects in the near future, as they positively increase user experiences. As always, I will carry on improving my skillsets and create my very own JavaScript API than using a library, watch this space!</p>
