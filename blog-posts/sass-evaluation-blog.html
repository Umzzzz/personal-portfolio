      <div id="project-button">
        <a href="http://umzdesigns.com/ms-project-sass/" title="Sass has been used in Mars Spiders site to improve loading speed and efficiency of coding">
          <div class="view-project">View Project</div>
        </a>
      </div>

      <p>Aim of this project was to be able to reduce current CSS code on Mars Spiders site, so that the site can load faster. Objective of this project was to show how Sass has improved the workflow in Mars Spiders project.</p>

      <p>"Not only increase the speed of your website but to increase your productivity." (Vicious, 2014: online)</p>

      <p>To demonstrate how I have achieved my aim and objectives, I have run various loading speed checks to show the difference between Sass and CSS. The online speed tools used were <a href="http://tools.pingdom.com/fpt/" title="Pingdom Website Speed Test">Pingdom</a>,
        <a href="https://gtmetrix.com/" title="Analyse your site speed and make it faster">GTMetrix</a> and <a href="http://www.pagescoring.com/website-speed-test/" title="Website Speed Test">Page Scoring</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="sub-headings">Pingdom- Mars Spiders Sass Speed Test</h2>

      <div class="pingdom-sass-test"><img src="../img/pingdom-sass-speed-test.png" alt="Sass version of Mars Spiders site being checked for loading speed through Pingdom"></div>

      <h2 class="sub-headings">Pingdom- Mars Spiders CSS Speed Test</h2>

      <div class="pingdom-css-test"><img src="../img/pingdom-css-speed-test.png" alt="CSS version of Mars Spiders site being checked for loading speed through Pingdom"></div>

      <p>First speed check was done through Pingdom. As you can see above the Sass loading speed came up as 1.16s and the CSS version of the site came up as 4.15s. Sass version of the site is faster by 2.99s.</p>

      <h2 class="sub-headings">GTMetrix- Mars Spiders Sass Speed Test</h2>

      <div class="gtmetrix-sass-test"><img src="../img/gtmetrix-sass-speed-test.png" alt="Sass version of Mars Spiders site being checked for loading speed through GTMetrix"></div>

      <h2 class="sub-headings">GTMetrix- Mars Spiders CSS Speed Test</h2>

      <div class="gtmetrix-css-test"><img src="../img/gtmetrix-css-speed-test.png" alt="CSS version of Mars Spiders site being checked for loading speed through GTMetrix"></div>

      <p>Second speed check was done through GTMetrix. As you can see above the Sass loading speed came up as 1.8s. CSS version of site came up as 2.3s. Sass version of site is faster by 0.5s.</p>

      <h2 class="sub-headings">Page Scoring- Mars Spiders Sass Speed Test</h2>

      <div class="pagescoring-sass-test"><img src="../img/pagescoring-sass-speed-test.png" alt="Sass version of Mars Spiders site being checked for loading speed through Page Scoring"></div>

      <h2 class="sub-headings">Page Scoring- Mars Spiders CSS Speed Test</h2>

      <div class="pagescoring-css-test"><img src="../img/pagescoring-css-speed-test.png" alt="CSS version of Mars Spiders site being checked for loading speed through Page Scoring"></div>


      <p>Third speed check was done through Page Scoring. As you can see above the Sass loading speed came up 0.99s. CSS version of site came up as 3.6s. Sass version of site is faster by 2.61s.</p>

      <p>"According to surveys done by Akamai and Gomez.com, nearly half of web users expect a site to load in 2 seconds or less, and they tend to abandon a site that isn’t loaded within 3 seconds." (Jacob, no date: online)</p>

      <p>Sass version of Mars Spiders site has come on top in all speed tests done. The loading speed is under the 2 seconds or less barrier recommended by Akamai and Gomez.com. More users will access Mars Spiders site, as there is no lengthy waiting time.</p>

      <p>"Apply the Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle for CSS development."(Starostin, 2013: online)</p>

      <p>The benefit of coding a website with Sass is that it will reduce repetition of CSS code and will make your code cleaner and more readable. You can see the difference below:</p>

      <h2 class="sub-headings">Sass version of CSS code to Mars Spiders Site</h2>

      <div class="sass-reduce-code"><img src="../img/sass-reduce-code.png" alt="Coding with Sass has reduce the CSS code of Mars Spiders site"></div>

      <h2 class="sub-headings">Original CSS code of Mars Spiders Site</h2>

      <div class="original-css-code"><img src="../img/original-css-code.png" alt="Original CSS code of Mars Spiders site"></div>

      <p>Sass version of the site is 1176 lines of code and the CSS version of site is 1678 lines of code. By coding the site with Sass has reduce the length of coding by 502 lines. This is brilliant as Sass has cut out any repetition from the CSS code and made the coding more efficient.</p>

      <p>"The amount of impact this has had on my day-to-day development has been astronomical."(Bresnehan, 2013: online)</p>

      <p>Upcoming individuals who are looking to pursuit career in website development, especially front-end development. Sass is essential to learn, as this extension improves the work flow within companies in the digital industry.</p>

      <p>Sass speeds up your workflow and structures your code neatly and that’s why more and more companies are choosing to build websites with Sass. Not only that Sass can improve your traffic of your website, as this extension makes your site loading speed much quicker then CSS, as seen above in the illustrations.</p>

      <p>"Once the modules/patterns are in place, coding your site can be almost as quick as writing HTML." (Bouba, 2014: online)</p>

      <p>One of the advantages of using Sass is that it will speed up your development time and this is good for organisations, as they can meet client deadlines much quicker. Happy client = Increase Customers.</p>

      <p>Another benefit of Sass is that it looks like CSS and it’s easy to read and the features are easy to get your head around. Even if you came back to a project a year after finishing, you won’t get confuse by the coding you have done.</p>

      <p>“Installing yet another development framework just to run Sass is going to feel a bit wasteful of time and resources.” (Web Designer: 2015, online)</p>

      <p>If you’re Ruby on Rails developer then this won’t be a problem. But one of the disadvantages for people who are not into Ruby on Rails or lack coding ability, you can have problems when installing Sass for the first time, as Sass requires Ruby for installation.</p>

      <p>Sass has a lot of extra set up and features alongside Ruby and learning what each of these elements do can be time consuming. There is much easier set up and installations for Sass, for example <a href="https://mhs.github.io/scout-app/" title="Scout is a cross-platform app that delivers the power of Sass & Compass into the hands of web designers.">Scout</a> will compile the coding for you, without you typing into the command line like Ruby and Git.</p>

      <p>Overall, you have seen how Sass can improve the workflow of a project and why the industry is choosing this extension to write cleaner and efficient coding, as this will improve productivity and traffic for your websites.</p>
