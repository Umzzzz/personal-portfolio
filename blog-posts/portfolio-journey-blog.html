      <h1 class="blog-post-heading">Development Of Portfolio Website</h1>

      <p>The main concept of the design of my portfolio website was around parallax design. I like the feel and look of parallax design as a whole. The first stage of the development was research phase I did a lot of background research around this design
        layout. Inspiration came from other portfolio sites such as <a href="http://www.creativebloq.com/portfolios/examples-712368" title="A platform of showcasing creative portfolio website around the world">Creative Blog</a> and <a href="http://www.adhamdannaway.com/"
        title="Adam Dannaway's Portfolio Site">Adam Dannaway</a>.</p>

      <p>The research phase I created mood boards, which enable me to think about the type of fonts, designs and icons I would like to use for the site."Mood boards can be a great way to convey your design idea, win pitches and get an early sign-off."(Creative
        Blog, 2014: online)</p>

      <p>This helps me think about elements that I would need to create a beautiful site.</p>


      <div class="moodboard"><img src="../img/moodboard.png" alt="Visual moodboard for Umair Yaquoob's portfolio site using Photoshop"></div>

      <p>Part of the research stage I created user personas and journey for the site, this enable me to see how the users in particular the target audience would navigate around the site."Personas should guide the basic structure of the user experience you're
        building." (Mulder and Yaar, 2007:248) This helps me keep on track with my goals for the end product of what should really be delivered, as I refer back to the personas.</p>

      <p>The design phase involves me to draw out wireframes for the site. I did paper and visual version of wireframes using Photoshop. At an early stage I was able to see how the design would look without actually coding. "Wireframes represent a degree
        of look and feel." (Rosenfeld and Morville, 2002:285) This is a great method as you can spot out any issues with your design and you can make decisions to changes of design before the development stage.</p>

      <p>I wanted to push my design skills even further with this site, so I carefully thought about colour schemes, typography and icons to represent links on the site. The icons were from <a href="http://www.flaticon.com/" title="Flat icon is a site you can get icons for your website">Flat Icon</a>.
        In regards to typography I kept it simple with one or two fonts. I came across a blog about the best 41 web fonts for 2015 from <a href="https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/resources/the-41-best-free-web-fonts-for-2015" title="Blog Post from Elegant Themes about the top 41 Web Fonts for 2015">Elegant Themes</a>.</p>

      <p>The fonts I chose to go with the site were 'Oswald' for the headings and 'Lato' for the paragraphs. These two fonts link up together nicely. Also the illustration of myself was done through Photoshop. I wanted a creative feel and look to the site.
        With the thoughtful headings for each section on the site, it gave that extra professional look.</p>

      <p>In regards to image optimisation I used the feature in Photoshop and online tool called <a href="https://tinyjpg.com/" title="Free online tool to allow you to optimize your images even further without loosing quality">tinyJPG</a>. I have optimised
        all my images to the best possible way, except the large background image for the home section, as you optimise this image you loose the quality, which gave the site an unprofessional look. </p>

      <p>In the development stage I applied Flexbox. "Flexbox is a remarkably intelligent solution to a long-standing convoluted problem." (Pettit, 2014: online) Flexbox allows the site to be viewed correctly to the right device the users view the site on.
        I wanted a smooth scroll to the site so that when users click on the navigation links, they were not jumping to the section. To do this element I implemented JavaScript and JQuery.</p>

      <p>I have done a lot of reading around on applying the best solution for scrolling effect for this site. Inspiration has come from <a href="http://javascriptbook.com/" title="JavaScript and JQuery Book by Jon Duckett">JavaScript and JQuery</a> by Jon
        Duckett and code snips from <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/smooth-scrolling/" title="Code Snips of scrolling effect using JavaScipt and JQuery from CSS Tricks">CSS tricks</a>.These sources enable me to figure out how to apply
        scrolling effect to fit with my site.</p>

      <p>Responsive design was another major part of development stage. As responsive is web standard now, you are required to have sites compatible for multi devices. This part of the development was done with media queries. So that users can access the
        site anywhere using different devices such as PC, Tablets and Mobile Phones. I have set media queries from small screen (mobile) to big screen (PC). Google developer responsive plugin tool help me to keep on checking the site on various devices
        so that I could get elements of the site to fit accurately to the view screen of multiple devices.</p>

      <p>Prior to the launch of the site, throughout the process of creating this site I got consistent feedback of family, friends and fellow students about the design, looks and feel of the site. This enables me to do any changes before I launch the site.
        I conducted multiple testing to make sure my site meets the required W3C standards of HTML coding and Accessibility for impaired users. Also cross browser testing was done to check if the site is compatible for different browsers use.</p>

      <p>Overall I was happy with the development of this project, as this pushed my coding and designing skills even further. I had some ups and downs with this project as you do, which will keep on improving me as a web developer for future projects. This
        was a great learning process.</p>
