	  </div>

      <p>Aim of this project was to allow users and clients to chat on the website easily via a chat box. Objective of this project was to be able to implement a JavaScript API chat box towards Mars Spiders needs.</p>

      <p>During this project the aims and objective have been met, I will show evidence later in this blog on how these aims and objective have been a success.</p>

      <p>“44% of online consumers say that having questions answered by a live person while in the middle of an online purchase is one of the most important features a Web site can offer.” (Levin, no date: online)</p>

      <p>Mars Spiders would benefit from having a live chat box on their site, as it will draw potentials clients, as there is somebody live and ready to answer inquires instantly, about services their clients would like to have.</p>

      <p>“According to a poll by Andersen Consulting, almost 62 percent of Internet consumers said they would purchase more products online if live customer support were available.” (Bmower, 2014: online)</p>

      <p>Live chat box would increase sales for Mars Spiders as clients do not have to wait for a lengthy time from receiving responses by email or phone. This will increase sales as customers would be happy with the online customer experiences they have been provided with, happy customers = increase profits.</p>

      <p>“Traffic is likely to increase for companies with chat features than companies without the features.” (Parson, 2014: online)</p>

      <p>Due to the great customer experiences with having live chat boxes on your site, this would increase traffic to your site as users would keep on coming back; the more traffic received the higher Mars Spiders site would rank.</p>

      <p>“A 2012 Aberdeen Group Report shows that it’s common for companies to save as much as 50% on support costs with live chat versus using traditional phone support.”(Gao, 2015: online)</p>

      <p>This is great feature to have on a site for Mars Spiders, as having a live chat box would be cost effective and would reduce the high costs of phone bills.</p>

      <p>“Provide additional opportunities to learn valuable usability information.”(Tomlin, 2009: online)</p>

      <p>Chat boxes are accessible and usable for users to use, as they stay in one place, most commonly in the bottom right like Facebook chat. Also it’s a great way to conduct user testing with your users to see their tasks flow of your site and what they think about the live chat box feature.</p>
	  
	  <p>As you can see below, with series of screenshots of the live chat box working on the website:</p>
	  
	 <div class="slide-up"><img src="../img/chat-slide-up.jpg" alt="Live chat box slides up as soon as you scroll on the page on the site"></div>
	  
	  <p>Chat box slides up to start off with to draw user’s attention.</p>
	  
	  <div class="fill-name"><img src="../img/fill-name-chat.jpg" alt="Live chat box ask to fill in name before sending a request to chat to Mars Spiders staff"></div>
	  
	  <p>Click the add button and then another screen will pop up, to prompt the user to fill in full name before starting the chat. Then the user clicks “Send Chat Request”.</p>
	  
	  <div class="chat-convo"><img src="../img/chat-convo.jpg" alt="Live chat as started and users and the operators can start their conversions online"></div>
	  
	  <p>A conversation has began with the user and the operator of the site.</p>
	  
	  <div class="admin-dashboard"><img src="../img/admin-dashboard-chat.png" alt="The operators send and receive messages through the back end using the live chat dashboard."></div>
	  
	  <p>The operators receive the messages from users on their chat page, ready to respond to the users. The messages the operators send back to the users, will be seen in the chat box instantly.</p>
	  
	  <div class="close-chat"><img src="../img/close-chat.jpg" alt="The user has close the chat and has option to rate the experience"></div>
	  
	  <p>User have closed the chat with cross button, they have an option to rate their experiences with customer services provided by operators. Also they get an option to download the transcript of the full conversation that was taken place.</p>
	  
	  <div class="email-chat"><img src="../img/email-chat.jpg" alt="If the operators are offline, the user has option to send an email"></div>
	  
	  <p>If the operators are not available at the time when the users is visiting the site, they have an option to send an offline message, which would go to the operators email inbox.</p>
	  
	  <div class="email-send"><img src="../img/email-send.jpg" alt="The users can instant confirmation that their email been send"></div>
	  
	  <p>Users get an instant assurance that their email has been send to the operators.</p>
	  
	  <div class="email-received"><img src="../img/email-received.jpg" alt="Email has been received to the operators, ready to email back to the users"></div>
	  
	  <p>As you can see the operators receive the email send by users instantly in their in-boxes, ready to respond back.</p>
	  
	  <div class="responsive-chat"><img src="../img/responsive-chat.png" alt="Live chat works in responsive mode"></div>
	  
	  <p>In responsive mode the live chat feature works well on the site, as it appears in a tab button format, which is easily clickable.</p>
	  
	  <div class="chat-app"><img src="../img/chat-app.png" alt="Mobile app version of live chat"></div>
	  
	  <p>Once the user clicks the chat button, it sends them to a mobile app version of the chat box, ready to use instantly.</p>
	  
	  <p>Overall, you have seen the benefits of chat boxes and how they operate with accessibility and ease of usability in mind.</p>
