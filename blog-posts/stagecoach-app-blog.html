      <h1 class="blog-post-heading">Stagecoach App (UX)</h1>

      <h2 class="sub-headings">Digital Product:</h2>

      <p>First of all, as a squad we discussed ideas of what we should do for our project. These were the ideas the squad came up with, they are the following: Travel app (Stagecoach), Night life in Manchester(Clubs), redesign for tram apps(Metro link) and
        sport facilities in Manchester for students.</p>

      <p>After alot of consideration my squad decided to do Stagecoach app as this is unique as the bus company do not have a travel app in the market.</p>

      <div class="ideas"><img src="../img/initial-ideas.png" alt="Coming up with initials ideas for the squad UX Project"></div>

      <h2 class="sub-headings">Research:</h2>

      <p>This stage required, as a squad to look at competitors out there with similar apps to our travel app, the competitors we chosen to look at were First, Trainline and London Travel. We did an in depth competitor analysis to what were good, bad and
        any improvements that can be made to the apps. Then we did User Personas and User Requirements for the Stagecoach app.</p>

      <p>During the Personas, we asked three users about what they like about current apps and what would they like for further improvements in a new travel app. Once this part was done we were able to come up with user requirements of the app, which included
        problems with current apps, insights, needs and trends.</p>

      <p>This led to User journey(storyboarding), this enable us to put real personas to life by telling a story through sketched storyboards of how they would use the Stagecoach app in their daily routines.</p>

      <div class="persona"><img src="../img/user-persona.png" alt="Andrew Hopkins is one of the User Personas for Stagecoach app"></div>

      <h2 class="sub-headings">Draw:</h2>

      <p>Drawing stage required myself as an individual, to draw a low-fi sketch of the main home page, to contribute towards ideas for the group version of the whole app . After everyone in the squad did their own individual drawings of the main page, we
        came together to combine all our ideas to create a paper version of the whole Stagecoach app.</p>

      <p>This process led to the paper testing of the app, where as a squad we asked questions(tasks) for the the users to perform during the test sessions. This enable us to record what was happening during the session of any comments the users had about
        the app, whether they were good, bad or any improvements need to make towards the functionality and the design of the app.</p>

      <div class="questions"><img src="../img/questions.png" alt="Tasks set for users to perform during the paper testing session"></div>


      <h2 class="sub-headings">Axure Wireframes:</h2>

      <p>Axure Wireframes of the whole app was an individual contribution. This enable myself to turn the group paper sketches into a digital wireframes by adding my own twist on the design. This also allowed the design to be click-able. I kept it simple
        with icons representing the navigation elements throughout the app.</p>

      <p>This version of the design can be viewed: <a href="http://zzxfhv.axshare.com/#p=home" title="Axure digital wireframes of Umair Yaquoob's individual contribution towards the Stagecoach app"> Axure Wireframes Design</a></p>

      <h2 class="sub-headings">Test:</h2>

      <p>Another testing session was taken place for the individual Axure Wireframes design, internally with members from the squads and externally with family, friends and other users for the testing sessions. This enable me to find out what was good, bad
        and any improvements needed to the functionality and design of the Stagecoach app.</p>


      <h2 class="sub-headings">Design:</h2>

      <p>This required me as an individual to put creative flair to the app by designing a visual version of the wireframes through Photoshop. During this process I went for creativity by adding colourful icons and staying with the brand identity colours
        of Stagecoach. Also created detailed content on each page to show a true feeling of how the app would look like if it was ever launched.</p>

      <div class="stagecoach"><img src="../img/stagecoach.png" alt="Home page of Umair Yaquoob's Photoshop design of Stagecoach app"></div>

      <p>After Photoshop, I pushed my designs to Invision, which enable the design to have A true mobile experience by adding mobile template and mobile touching gesture throughout the app. This version of the app can be viewed:</p>

      <h2 class="sub-headings">Evaluation:</h2>

      <p>The process was a great learning curve, I really enjoyed this project, it put my creativity into use.Also its gave me another career option to go into as UX Designer. Overall the users loved the final version design of the app as they said during
        the final test, they would love to use this app if it was ever to be launched.</p>
